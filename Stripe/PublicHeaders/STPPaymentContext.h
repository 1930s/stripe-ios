 An STPPaymentContext keeps track of all of the state around a payment. It will manage fetching a user's saved payment methods, tracking any information they select, and prompting them for required additional information before completing their purchase. It can be used to power your application's "payment confirmation" page with just a few lines of code. It requires an "API Adapter" to communicate with your backend API to retrieve and modify a customer's payment methods - see STPBackendAPIAdapter.h for how to implement this. You can also see CheckoutViewController.swift in our example app to see STPPaymentContext in action.

You should go to your backend API with this `source` and make a charge to complete the payment, and once that's done call `sourceCompletion` with any error that occurred (or none, if the charge succeeded).
