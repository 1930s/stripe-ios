/**
 *  This callback will be yielded with two arguments: a Stripe token (may be nil, if the user cancels the form) and another callback. If the token is present, you can submit it to your backend API to either create a charge or attach it to a customer. When that is done, call tokenCompletion with any error that occurred (it'll be shown to the user and they'll be able to resubmit the form). If your backend API call succeeds, you should dismiss the view controller and move the user to the next step of your UI.
 *
 *  @param token           A valid Stripe token, or nil if the user presses the "cancel" button.
 *  @param tokenCompletion A callback to call once you're done passing the token to your server.

/** This view controller contains a credit card entry form that the user can fill out. On submission, it will use the Stripe API to convert the user's card details to a Stripe token. It renders a right bar button item that submits the form, so it must be shown inside a UINavigationController.

/**
 *  Returns a new view controller with a credit card form.
 *
 *  @param publishableKey Your Stripe publishable key. If you've called [Stripe setDefaultPublishableKey:] in your app delegate, you can just use [Stripe defaultPublishableKey] here.
 *  @param configuration The configuration the view controller will use. This can be used to set the required billing address fields, among other things. @see STPPaymentConfiguration.h
 *  @param completion                   A block that will be called when the user has successfully submitted their information, or pressed cancel. If they submit their information, the token parameter will be a valid STPToken object. If they cancel, it will be nil. When this is called, the user will see a spinner on the form. This gives your application time to send the token to your backend and add it to a customer or complete a charge. When you're done, call the `tokenCompletion` parameter with whether or not your call succeeded, and then dismiss the form if it succeeded.
 *
 *  @return a view controller that you can either embed in a UINavigationController and present modally, or push onto an existing UINavigationController stack.
