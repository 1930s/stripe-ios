/**
 *  This callback will be yielded with two arguments: a Stripe token (may be nil, if the user cancels the form) and another callback. If the token is present, you can submit it to your backend API to either create a charge or attach it to a customer. When that is done, call tokenCompletion with any error that occurred (it'll be shown to the user and they'll be able to resubmit the form). If your backend API call succeeds, you should dismiss the view controller and move the user to the next step of your UI.
 *
 *  @param token           A valid Stripe token, or nil if the user presses the "cancel" button.
 *  @param tokenCompletion A callback to call once you're done passing the token to your server.

 *  Returns a new view controller with a credit card form.
 *
 *  @param configuration The configuration for the view controller to use. This lets you set your Stripe publishable API key, required billing address fields, and if you want to disable SMS autofill. @see STPPaymentConfiguration.h
 *  @param theme         The theme describing the visual appearance of the view controller. @see STPTheme.h
 *  @param completion    A block that will be called when the user has successfully submitted their information, or pressed cancel. If they submit their information, the token parameter will be a valid STPToken object. If they cancel, it will be nil. When this is called, the user will see a spinner on the form. This gives your application time to send the token to your backend and add it to a customer or complete a charge. When you're done, call the `tokenCompletion` parameter with whether or not your call succeeded, and then dismiss the form if it succeeded.
 *
 *  @return a view controller that you can either embed in a UINavigationController and present modally, or push onto an existing UINavigationController stack.
