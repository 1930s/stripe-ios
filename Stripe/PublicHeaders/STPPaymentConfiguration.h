 Options for 3D Secure support.

 - STPThreeDSecureSupportTypeDisabled: Your customer will never be prompted for 
 3DS verification.

 - STPThreeDSecureSupportTypeStatic: Your customer will be prompted for 
 3DS verification if available.  If 3DS is not available, the original card 
 source will be passed to your app. Note that if you charge a card source, you 
 will not be protected from fraud by 3DS. If you want to reject all card payments
 that haven't passed 3DS verification, you should update your logic accordingly 
 in paymentContext:didCreatePaymentResult:completion: if the payment result is
 a card source, instead of passing the source to your backend to be charged, you
 should call the completion block with an error.
