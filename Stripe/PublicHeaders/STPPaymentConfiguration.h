 Possible values for 3DS source support

 - STPThreeDSecureSupportTypeDisabled: 3DS sources will  never be created
 - STPThreeDSecureSupportTypeStatic: An attempt to create 3DS sources will be done for all card sources that may possibly support 3ds
   A failure to create a 3DS source for a card that does not require 3DS will result in the original card source being passed through 
   to your backend API adapter for charging. If you want to forbid all non-3DS payments, you should not charge and throw an error
   when receiving any non-3DS card source to charge.
