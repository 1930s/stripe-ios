It provides a "bridge" from the prebuilt UI we expose (such as STPPaymentMethodsViewController) to your backend to fetch the information it needs to power those views.

Also specifically return the user's currently selected card. (For an example Ruby implementation of this API, see https://github.com/stripe/example-ios-backend/blob/master/web.rb#L40 ). Back in your iOS app, after you've called this API, create an STPCard object for the user's selected card (see [STPCard cardWithID:brand:last4:expMonth:expYear:funding]) and the array of their cards, and call `completion` with this information. See MyAPIClient.swift in our example project to see this in action.
