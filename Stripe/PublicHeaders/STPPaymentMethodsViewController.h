 *  An STPPaymentMethodsViewControllerDelegate responds when a user selects a payment method from (or cancels) an STPPaymentMethodsViewController. In both of these instances, you should dismiss the view controller (either by popping it off the navigation stack, or dismissing it). If you are popping it off of a UINavigationController stack, be aware that it may have already pushed additional view controllers (such as an STPAddCardViewController) onto the stack, so don't call -popViewControllerAnimated: on your UINavigationController. Instead, call -popToViewController: on your navigation controller, with the view controller that was behind the STPPaymentMethodsViewController as the first argument.

 *  This is called when the user either makes a selection, or adds a new card. This will be triggered after the view controller loads with the user's current selection (if they have one) and then subsequently when they change their choice. You should use this callback to update any necessary UI in your app that displays the user's currently selected payment method. You should *not* dismiss the view controller at this point, instead do this in paymentMethodsViewControllerDidFinish:. STPPaymentMethodsViewController will also call the necessary methods on your API adapter, so you don't need to call them directly during this method.
